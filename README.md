## Usage

This project provides a basic structure for building web applications with Laravel and front-end tools. You can customize and extend it to fit your specific needs.

### Front-end

All front-end assets are located in the `resources/assets` directory. WebpackMix is used to build and compile assets, which are then stored in the `public` directory.

To build assets for development, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To build assets for production, run:

```
npm run production
```

### Back-end

All back-end code is located in the `app` directory. Laravel follows the MVC pattern, so you'll find models, controllers, and views in their respective directories.
